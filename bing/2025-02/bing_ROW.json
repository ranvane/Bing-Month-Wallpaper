        "description": "Today's image takes us to Taktsang Palphug, also known as the Tiger's Nest, a Buddhist monastery and holy site perched 3,000 metres above sea level in Bhutan. Built around the Taktsang Senge Samdup cave in 1692, it is where Guru Padmasambhava, who introduced Vajrayana Buddhism to Bhutan, meditated and taught his students. According to legend, an emperor's former wife, out of devotion, transformed into a tigress and carried Guru Padmasambhava from Tibet to Taktsang in Bhutan. There, he meditated in a cave and emerged in eight incarnations, which is why it is known as the 'Tiger's Nest.' Paro Taktsang is made up of four main temples, all connected by stairways cut into the cliff face, as well as a handful of rickety bridges. There are three main routes to reach the monastery, with the most popular path winding through a forest decorated with prayer flags. The hike is demanding but rewarding, providing breathtaking views of the surrounding landscape."

        "description": "Polar bears are native to the Arctic and can be found in Alaska, Russia, Greenland and Svalbard. They're also found in Canada—like the cub in today's image, photographed in Churchill, Manitoba. Polar bears spend over half of their time hunting for seals on the sea ice, although they usually catch just one or two for every 10 that they try to catch. Their reliance on sea ice for hunting means that they are highly vulnerable to climate change. Their fur isn't truly white; it's translucent, reflecting visible light and allowing them to blend seamlessly into their snowy environment. Sea ice is rapidly disappearing as the planet heats up, and polar bears are at risk of malnutrition and starvation as their hunting grounds vanish. Shrinking ice sheets also mean that these bears have to swim farther to find food, which depletes their energy reserves. Protecting polar bears means protecting their home—let's work together to slow the effects of climate change and safeguard their future."

People have lived in this area for at least 10,000 years, including the Anasazi, Pueblo and Paiute Peoples. The hoodoos—tall, thin spires of rock formed by erosion—in the park inspired Paiute mythology: they believed them to be the Legend People turned to stone by the trickster Coyote. The first European Americans arrived in the area in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and some eventually settled there in the 1850s. Bryce Canyon was named after Ebenezer Bryce, who had a homestead nearby. These days, the park is famous for its hoodoos. Every year, over 2 million visitors come to marvel at these geological formations. In fact, Bryce Canyon National Park has the highest concentration of hoodoos anywhere on Earth."

For centuries, Fujisan—as it is known in Japanese—has been worshipped as a sacred mountain. In the Shinto faith, Fuji is deified as Asama no Okami and shrines dedicated to it are built within sight of the mountain. Mount Fuji is one of Japan's cherished 'Three Holy Mountains' along with Mount Tate and Mount Haku. In 2013, it was recognised as a UNESCO World Heritage Site, highlighting its cultural importance."

The park, which lies along a picturesque stretch of the Mississippi River, commemorates Thomas Jefferson's idea of a continental nation. At its heart stands the Gateway Arch, a breathtaking 192-metre-tall structure that has become the symbol of St. Louis. Constructed of stainless steel, it holds the title of the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible structure. Finnish-American architect Eero Saarinen dreamed up the design back in 1947, and by October 28, 1965, his vision had been brought to life. The arch's futuristic design has long been viewed as a symbol of the automobile era, representing the modern, urban landscape and the promise of a technologically advanced future."

The stags have antlers that grow larger each year until maturity and are usually over 70 centimetres long, weighing around 1 kilogram. These antlers have long been a symbol of power and are the only mammal organ capable of complete regeneration. Females, or hinds, are slightly smaller and antler-free, as seen in today's image. Breeding season, known as the rut, is a time of dramatic display as males compete fiercely for mates through roaring and antler clashes. The cultural significance of red deer represents the natural cycle of life. Artistic depictions, from medieval manuscripts to modern sculptures, frequently highlight their grace and strength."

These semi-aquatic animals are built for agility, with streamlined bodies, webbed feet and dense fur that keeps them warm even in icy waters. A single square centimetre of their fur can hold more than 70,000 hairs, making it one of nature's most effective insulators. River otters were once endangered due to pollution and habitat loss. Yet, thanks to conservation efforts, their populations are rebounding in many regions across Europe."

These penguins, found in coastal Patagonia, are known for their distinctive black and white bands and their loud, braying calls. They also mate with the same partner every year. They dig burrows near the coast to lay their eggs and raise their chicks. The male returns to burrows he used the year before and waits for his partner, who can recognise him by his voice alone. Their diet mainly consists of small fish, squid and krill. They can dive up to 50 metres depth to forage for food. In winter, they migrate north to warmer waters, sometimes reaching as far as southern Brazil. These penguins are highly social and often seen in large colonies, where they communicate with each other through their distinctive calls. Fun fact: Penguins can drink seawater because they have a special gland that filters out the salt!"

Located in the United States, in southern Utah's Kane County, this spot in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area stands at an impressive height of 1,428 metres. Made mostly of Entrada Sandstone, it has the same geological roots as nearby sites like Romana Mesa, its parent peak and Gunsight Butte, another sandstone summit to the east."

        "description": "Winter turns Mestia's medieval towers into icy fortresses. Perched 1,500 metres up in the Caucasus Mountains, Mestia is a charming highland town in northwest Georgia. The town is home to the Svans, a cultural and linguistic subgroup of Georgians. Despite its modest size, Mestia has been an essential hub of Georgian culture for centuries, dotted with the Svan defensive towers, seen in today's image. Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia's Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region's history of resilience and self-sufficiency. Therefore, it isn't just a town; it's a living museum where history rises from these towers and echoes through the mountains."

        "description": "In Norway, winter isn't just a season—it's an experience. In the north of the country, nights stretch for 20 hours and there are entire weeks when the sun remains hidden below the horizon. It might sound bleak, but it's a unique time of the year. Why? Because around early afternoon, usually between 1 and 2 PM, a soft, lingering light reflects off the snow-covered ground and the deep blue sea. This forms a breathtaking, glassy blue glow that settles over the landscape. Each day, the blue hour arrives just a little later, a gentle reminder that the sun is slowly preparing to reclaim the sky."

        "description": "Welcome to the Archway Islands—a group of four rock stacks at Wharariki Beach in New Zealand. The islands are a result of wind and coastal erosion that have shaped the rocks into arches, caves and stacks. The rocks, which are around 55–65 million years old, are made of quartz- and feldspar-rich sandstones and pebbly conglomerates. Rising from the waters of the Tasman Sea, these rugged islets became well known around the world after they were featured in a Windows 10 desktop screensaver in 2015. At low tide, curious wanderers can explore caves and rock pools and often spot lounging seals."

        "description": "Being the 'black sheep' isn't always a bad thing—just ask the Scottish Blackface, seen here in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. With its striking dark features and a knack for thriving in places others wouldn't, this British breed has turned the idiom on its head. Far from an outcast, it's the backbone of Scotland's rural life and a true champion of the hills and moors. Interestingly, the Blackface sheep didn't originate in Scotland but south of the Anglo-Scottish border. The breed's history is fascinating, and varieties such as the large-framed Perth and the medium-framed Lanark types are found across the United Kingdom. Though it's the most common breed in the region, the Blackface sheep has spread across the world. Its coarse fleece is perfect for making durable products like carpets and tweeds—definitely not your average sweater material."

        "description": "The alpine marmot in today's image is a close relative of the groundhog, which is another species of marmot. The alpine marmot is native to central and southern Europe and can be found at altitudes between 800 and 3,200 metres. Weighing between 1.9 to 7 kilograms, they are easily recognised by their round faces, short tails and dense fur that helps them endure chilly mountain climates. When it comes to food, these creatures are herbivores with simple taste. These little champs spend their summer days grazing on grasses, herbs, roots, seeds and flowers, storing up energy for their big event: a roughly nine-month hibernation party. Sometimes they eat grain, worms, insects and spiders. Beyond their hibernation habits, alpine marmots live a highly social lifestyle. They communicate through a variety of vocal sounds, including sharp whistles to warn the group of predators like eagles or foxes. This strong sense of community is key to their survival."

The 'Burgrave Gebhard vom Stein' is first mentioned in a document of King Wenceslas I of Bohemia in 1233, presumably referring to Königstein. At that time the area belonged to the Kingdom of Bohemia. In the 16th century, the castle underwent significant expansion to become a Saxon state fortress, with the start of construction of the imposing 152.5-metre-deep castle well between 1566 and 1569 being an important milestone. It is still one of the deepest historic wells in Germany."
