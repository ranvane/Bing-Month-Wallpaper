Today marks the start of Losar, the new year festival celebrated in Tibetan Buddhism, which is observed in Tibet, Bhutan, Nepal, and parts of India. Losar celebrations run for 15 days, beginning the night before with a meal of guthuk—a traditional dumpling soup. The new year is rung in with an incense burning ceremony and visits to holy places to pray for good fortune in the year ahead."

Built around the 1440s by the Stewarts of Appin, its history includes royal visits and even a drunken wager that briefly transferred ownership to Clan Campbell. After falling into disrepair by the 19th century, it was lovingly restored in the mid-20th century and is still privately owned today. Visitors can explore this historic site on selected guided tours during the summer."

For centuries, Fujisan—as it is known in Japanese—has been worshiped as a sacred mountain. In the Shinto faith, Fuji is deified as Asama no Okami, and shrines dedicated to it are built within sight of the mountain."

The park, which lies along a picturesque stretch of the Mississippi River, commemorates Thomas Jefferson’s idea of a continental nation. At its heart stands the Gateway Arch, a breathtaking 630-foot-tall structure that has become the ultimate symbol of St. Louis. Constructed of stainless steel, it holds the distinction of being the world's tallest arch and Missouri's tallest accessible structure. Finnish American architect Eero Saarinen dreamed up the design back in 1947, and by October 28, 1965, his vision had been brought to life. The arch's futuristic design has long been viewed as a symbol of the automobile era, representing the modern, urban landscape, and the promise of a technologically advanced future."

They are built for agility, with streamlined bodies, webbed feet, and dense fur that keeps them warm even in icy waters. A single square inch of their fur can hold more than 400,000 hairs, making it one of nature's most effective insulators. River otters were once endangered due to pollution and habitat loss. Thanks to conservation efforts, their populations are rebounding in many regions across Europe."

Over time, climate changes caused water levels to drop; these days, the lake is normally dry, except in winter when it's covered in about 2 inches of water. The name 'Tyrrell' comes from the local Wergaia word for 'sky,' a nod to the Boorong Aboriginal People's interest in astronomy. Spanning more than 70 square miles, Lake Tyrrell is a haven for wildlife, including kangaroos, emus, and various reptiles."

Some are like ancient storyboards, depicting tales from Buddhist scriptures, while others showcase detailed carvings of monks, deities, musicians, and even scenes of daily life under Wei rule.

It wasn't until the 17th century that the umbrella, as we know it today, gained popularity in Europe, initially as a luxury item primarily for women. Fast-forward a few centuries, and these weather shields have become a staple in pop culture, too. Remember Mary Poppins with her iconic umbrella that helped her fly, or Rihanna's hit song 'Umbrella'?"

        "description": "Winter turns Mestia's medieval towers into icy fortresses. Perched 4,921 feet up in the Caucasus Mountains, Mestia is a charming highland town in northwest Georgia. The town is home to the Svans, a cultural and linguistic subgroup of Georgians. Despite its modest size, Mestia has been an essential hub of Georgian culture for centuries, dotted with the Svan defensive towers, seen in today's image. Most of these towers were constructed between the 9th and 12th centuries, a period often referred to as Georgia's Golden Age. However, their roots are believed to stretch even further back, possibly into prehistoric times. Built for both protection and shelter, these towers were not just fortresses but also integral parts of family homes, reflecting the region's history of resilience and self-sufficiency. Therefore, it isn't just a town; it's a living museum where history rises from these towers and echoes through the mountains."

        "description": "In Norway, winter isn't just a season—it's an experience. In the north of the country, nights stretch for 20 hours, and there are entire weeks when the sun remains hidden below the horizon. It might sound bleak, but it's a unique time of the year. Why? Because around early afternoon, usually between 1 and 2 PM, a soft, lingering light reflects off the snow-covered ground and the deep blue sea. This forms a breathtaking, glassy blue glow that settles over the landscape. Each day, the blue hour arrives just a little later, a gentle reminder that the sun is slowly preparing to reclaim the sky."

A day that New Zealanders still commemorate: Waitangi Day. On this date, the Treaty of Waitangi was signed, establishing the principles for how the two cultures would coexist. Ceremonies are held at Waitangi Treaty Grounds—where the document was signed—featuring traditional Māori performances, speeches, and the ever-dramatic waka (canoe) races. From festivals and concerts in cities like Auckland and Wellington to low-key community gatherings, the spirit of the day is about connection and culture."

With its striking dark features and a knack for thriving in places where others wouldn't, this British breed has turned the idiom on its head. Far from an outcast, it's the backbone of Scotland's rural life and a true champion of the hills and moors. Interestingly, the Blackface sheep didn't originate in Scotland but south of the Anglo-Scottish border."

This Victorian structure, also known as Batty Moss Viaduct, has been carrying trains and turning heads since the 1870s. Built by the Midland Railway, it's the longest and third tallest on the Settle–Carlisle railway line. Stretching 440 yards across the Ribble Valley, its 24 stone arches reach a height of 104 feet."

        "description": "It's Groundhog Day … again. Today, Americans and Canadians rely on the prognostication skills of Punxsutawney Phil to determine if winter will hang on. Phil is a famous groundhog, also known as a woodchuck, and legend has it that if he emerges from his burrow February 2 and sees his own shadow, he'll go back to sleep for another six weeks of winter. If he doesn't, it will be an early spring. German immigrants brought the custom to America, where it was first celebrated in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania, in 1887. Historically, Europeans celebrated February 2 as the first day of spring, and Germans originally watched badgers and other small animals for signs of seasonal change important to farmers. The Germans who settled in Pennsylvania in the 18th and 19th centuries chose the area's native groundhog for this task."

The forerunner of Black History Month was created in 1926 by historian Carter Woodson and minister Jesse Moorland to study and promote the legacy of Black Americans. The weeklong celebration was observed in the second week of February to coincide with the birthdays of President Abraham Lincoln and African American abolitionist Frederick Douglass. Its popularity grew over the next 50 years in large part because of the civil rights movement, and President Gerald Ford expanded it to a full month in 1976. Other countries honor their own Black histories, including Canada, which also celebrates Black History Month throughout February."
