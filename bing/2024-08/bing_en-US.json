This UNESCO World Heritage Site is famed for its rock formations and cave art. More than 15,000 ancient engravings, some dating back 12,000 years, depict scenes of daily life, hunting, and mystical beings."

Found in tropical oceans, these filter feeders glide through the water, mouths wide open, straining plankton and small fish. The patterns on their dotted, starry skin are as unique as a human fingerprint. Sadly, the International Union for Conservation of Nature lists whale sharks as endangered due to overfishing, habitat loss, and climate change."

Many of the buildings, which are made of the same basalt that the town stands on, seem to teeter on the edge of the precipice. Pictured at the end of the crag is the 13th-century church of Sant Salvador."

Delegations from 184 nations will parade down the iconic Champs-Élysées to the Place de la Concorde, rather than entering a stadium. The first official Paralympic Games were held in Rome in 1960. Twenty-three nations took part, competing in eight sports, including wheelchair basketball and Para athletics."

These caimans are the largest species in the alligator family, growing up to 20 feet and weighing as much as 1,000 pounds. Their dark color helps them blend into the murky depths. These carnivorous creatures thrive in freshwater environments such as slow-moving rivers, lakes, and seasonally flooded savannas. From these waters, they hunt for birds, fish, turtles, and occasionally big mammals. Black caimans play an important role in making sure ecosystems stay balanced by keeping the populations of their prey under control. More caimans mean fewer piranhas, which attack cattle, and fewer capybaras, which can cause crop damage."

        "description": "Discover the beauty of Vancouver Island, Canada. The wooden pathway in today's image, surrounded by ancient pine and cedar trees, leads to Kennedy Lake, the largest freshwater body on the island. The lake covers a surface area of 16,000 acres. It is part of the ancestral lands of the Tla-o-qui-aht First Nation where the Clayoquot and Kennedy Rivers meet. Tofino, over 24 miles away, has a real surf vibe. This small coastal town is a sanctuary for hikers, bird watchers, artists, and dreamers. Famous for its mild winters and pleasant summers, it has been a filming location for movies like 'The Twilight Saga: New Moon' and 'One Week.'"
