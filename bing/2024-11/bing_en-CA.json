A fisherman by trade, St. Andrew was one of Jesus' apostles and a key figure in Christianity. Though he never set foot in Scotland, his influence is immortalised in the country's Saltire flag, which is said to represent the cross on which he was martyred."

The story of this 'Wonder of the West' goes back to the early 8th century, when Archangel Michael was said to have appeared to the bishop of Avranches in a vision. The divine message was clear: build a sanctuary on this rock. Taking this angelic advice seriously, the bishop laid the foundations of what would eventually become the abbey that dominates the island today. Over the centuries, this UNESCO World Heritage Site grew in size and reputation, attracting monks, pilgrims and invaders alike."

Established in 1922, this park in British Columbia is named after the tallest peak in the southern Rockies, which stands at 3,618 metres. The park is home to Assiniboine Lodge, the first ski lodge in the Canadian Rockies, built in 1928. With no road access, anyone who wants to visit the park must either hike or take a helicopter ride, making the journey an adventure in itself. But the effort is worth it: this UNESCO World Heritage Site boasts stunning landscapes, from glaciers and lakes to towering peaks and limestone caves. There are multiple hiking trails that will take trekkers through forests, across meadows and up mountains. It's also a popular spot for cross-country skiing and alpine mountaineering. If you're looking for a place where every view is a masterpiece, Mount Assiniboine Provincial Park may just be it."

The name originates from a local legend about a Gallic giant, Treviso, who chose to leap off the cliffs of Rocher des Gattes rather than be captured by Roman soldiers. This vantage point, popular among hikers and road-trippers, provides a view that shifts dramatically with the seasons. During autumn, the landscape dons warm colours, as seen in today's image, making it an ideal spot for nature enthusiasts and photographers."

From there, they were spread to the Greek islands and mainland by the Phoenicians, then further afield, reaching Spain and the western edge of the Mediterranean by around 1000 BCE. The olive branch has been a symbol of peace since ancient times, and olive trees have been grown for their oil, wood and fruit for millennia."

They're also faster than you might think, being able to sprint over short distances up to 60 kilometres per hour. Giraffes are common in east Africa and can be seen grazing in grasslands, woodlands and reserves."

History buffs will enjoy exploring the sea stack formation marked with rubbing marks believed to have been made by mammoths that roamed the area 40,000 years ago. The park is also home to historical sites like Bodega Head, where Russians built a fort in the early 1800s."

He's most famous, however, for his sequence of numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8... By adding the first two numbers, you arrive at the third and adding the previous two numbers, you arrive at the next number, and so on. Disregarding the zero, the first four numbers correspond to today's date, 11/23."

Over the years, it withstood countless battles of the Reconquista—the military campaigns waged by Christian kingdoms against Muslim rule in Spain—as well as in the Castilian Civil War of the 14th century."

The town's rugged coastline, with its hidden rocky coves, has always posed a perilous challenge to sailors. Porthcawl lighthouse was built to help guide the increasing maritime traffic along the Bristol Channel. This cast-iron lighthouse was the last one in the United Kingdom to be powered by coal and gas. Although it was converted to electric power in 1997, the lighthouse still maintains its historical charm."

Believed to be the oldest village in the Cinque Terre, dating to 1338, Manarola's history is rooted in fishing and winemaking. Sciacchetrà, a dessert wine unique to this area, has long been immortalised in the verses of Italian poets."

The story of this otherworldly landscape starts 65 million years ago when a dry seabed stood here. Over time, geological forces warped and squeezed the land, twisting the sandstone into lumps and bumps. Later, wind and water carved out the arches, pinnacles, fins and balanced rocks that now stand in this area. The park has more than 2,000 natural stone arches, the highest concentration of these structures anywhere on Earth. In today's image, we can see two of them: Double Arch, as seen through Cove Arch. The larger arch of Double Arch spans 44 metres and is 34 metres tall, the tallest and second-longest of the park's arches."

Established in 1885, it became the first national park in the country following the discovery of hot springs near Sulphur Mountain. Over time, Banff's boundaries expanded, and it became part of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks UNESCO World Heritage Site. Spanning over 6,600 square kilometres, this national park transforms into a snowy playground during the winter, attracting visitors eager for skiing, snowshoeing, curling, skijoring and wildlife tours that offer plenty to explore. Despite the cold, life thrives in the park: it's home to a variety of wildlife, including elk, grizzly bears, mountain goats and wolves. Lodgepole pines and spruces also stand resilient against harsh weather. Banff's flora and fauna are closely monitored, ensuring that this balance remains intact."

        "description": "Ever seen a group of flamingos take to the skies? If you have, there's a good chance they were Caribbean flamingos, also known as American flamingos, as seen in Yucatán Peninsula, Mexico, in today's image. Flamingos are referred to as a flamboyance when in a group, but they can also be called a stand, colony or pat. The Caribbean flamingo is the largest flamingo species in the Americas and the only one native to North America. These vibrant birds are typically found around brackish and saltwater areas, like marshes, estuaries and along coastlines. Because of their pink colour, they're often confused with roseate spoonbills. However, their long necks and bent bills distinguish them from other wading birds like the great blue heron and wood stork."

Every star you see is part of our galaxy, the Milky Way, which gets its name from the way it appears as a creamy band of light in the darkest skies. In today's image, you can see this cosmic beauty glowing over Aït Benhaddou, a historic ksar—a kind of fortified village—in the Ouarzazate province of Morocco. This site was first fortified in the 11th century. It was a key stop on the ancient caravan trade route connecting the Sahara and the city of Marrakesh."

        "description": "Glacial rivers in 'the land of fire and ice'—Iceland—have shaped the landscape over thousands of years. The rivers seen in today's image are formed from the meltwater of vast glaciers like Vatnajökull, Langjökull and Hofsjökull. Vatnajökull, the largest ice cap in Iceland, covers over 7,500 square kilometres—approximately 10% of the country's landmass. As the glaciers melt, the water carries fine sediments, creating a braided river system with a milky appearance that contrasts with the earthy tones of the volcanic terrain. Every spring and summer, the rivers swell with seasonal meltwater, continually shaping and reshaping the land. Aerial views reveal their intricate patterns, resembling complex artworks that interweave across the terrain toward the North Atlantic Ocean. The water in Iceland is more than just a beautiful sight; it plays a significant role in renewable energy. Its flow powers hydroelectric power stations, reinforcing Iceland's status as a leader in sustainable energy."

These canines, seen in British Columbia in today's image, thrive in this ecosystem, which stretches from the north of Vancouver Island to the Alaskan border. This unique subspecies of the grey wolf is specific to the region and leads a semi-aquatic lifestyle, swimming between islands in search of food. Their diet primarily consists of fish, clams, mussels, crabs, otters and seals. This marine-based diet is a major difference with other wolf species, which feed almost exclusively on meat. These animals live in closely bonded groups, communicating with each other through growls, barks and whines, so they're often heard before they are seen."

Within it lies Shi Shi Beach, a serene stretch where the Pacific laps against sea stacks and sandy shores, as seen in today's image. Recognised as an International Biosphere Reserve, this national park features over 890 kilometres of trails, where hikers can embark on a trek along the coast to see the beach's sea arch at Point of the Arches, an outcrop that has over 30 sea stacks, columns of rock rising from the beach."

This village was once the cherished residence of the celebrated poet William Wordsworth, who described it as 'the loveliest spot that man hath found.' Here, visitors are greeted by old cottages and homes built from local bluish-green slate. Dove Cottage, Wordsworth's humble abode from 1799 to 1808, and the adjacent museum offer a dive into the poet's life. His later residence, Rydal Mount, continues the story just a short journey away. The heart of the village is St. Oswald's Church, which dates to the 13th century. This landmark is Wordsworth's final resting place. Not far from the church, the aroma of the renowned Grasmere Gingerbread, made from a secret recipe, will set visitors' mouths watering. The village's annual Grasmere Sports, which began in 1868, is an event that showcases traditional Lakeland activities like fell running, wrestling and hound trailing."

These animals were a key part of life for many Native American tribes, providing food, clothing and tools. Their population dwindled perilously low in the late 1800s, falling from as many as 60 million to fewer than 1,000 due to excessive hunting and disease. Enter a group of conservationists, ranchers and Native Americans who stepped in to save the species. Now, over 500,000 bison roam again, many in protected areas like Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, United States, featured in today's image."
