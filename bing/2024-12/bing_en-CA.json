        "description": "New Year's Eve, also known as Old Year's Day, is celebrated around the world with revelry, fireworks and, for some, religious and cultural observances. Many countries celebrate with foods symbolic of prosperity, long life and good fortune for the coming year. At the stroke of midnight, many people sing the Scottish folk song 'Auld Lang Syne' to remember old friends and past experiences. The new year is often personified as a baby, a tradition dating back to the ancient Greeks, and is frequently paired with an old man representing the previous year."

Covering more than 150 square kilometres, it's one of the state's oldest national parks. As you follow the winding road up through the park, you'll see a whole range of landscapes, from temperate rainforests full of some of the world's tallest eucalyptus trees to alpine moorland. These ever-changing views are what give the park its nickname, 'the park for all seasons.' One of the park's must-visit sites is Russell Falls, a three-tiered waterfall that plunges 50 metres."

This ancient sanctum has withstood centuries of natural challenges, including volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, thanks to its advanced interlocking stone system. Historically, Borobudur was an important pilgrimage site. After being abandoned for centuries, it was rediscovered in the 19th century by the English lieutenant governor Thomas Stamford Raffles."

Found along the coastlines of over 140 countries, they nest in more than 80 countries year-round. They are rarely found in Canada because they prefer warmer, tropical and subtropical waters, which Canadian waters do not provide. Despite their size and strength, they face significant challenges, including hunting, boat collisions and entanglement in fishing nets. In the image, the turtle is gliding over staghorn coral, a threatened species of marine invertebrates. This coral can grow to around 2 metres and is crucial to marine ecosystems. Thanks to its rapid growth, it acts as a marine nursery for juvenile fish, as well as providing buffer zones against erosion and storms. Let's take a moment to appreciate the progress we've made in protecting our planet's most vulnerable species—and remember that the work is far from over."

The 2-kilometre lake, surrounded by the snow-dusted Julian Alps, was formed over 14,000 years ago through glacial and tectonic activity. The first signs of settlement on Bled Island date back to the New Stone Age (10,000 BCE to 3,000 BCE). Additionally, archaeologists uncovered an Early Medieval graveyard here from the 9th century CE. Today, it houses the Church of the Assumption—built in its current form near the end of the 17th century—where visitors ring the 'wishing bell' for good luck."

This celebration centres around the unadorned aluminium Festivus pole. After dinner, the traditional Festivus 'airing of grievances' gets underway. This consists of telling friends and family the ways they've disappointed you over the year. According to some mental health professionals, this tradition could be good for people's mental well-being, providing some much-needed catharsis at what can be a difficult time of year for many people."

Some of the world's most famous Stone Age monuments, including Stonehenge, are aligned with the point that the sun rises or sets on the winter solstice. Traditionally, it was a time for feasting and lighting of fires to symbolise the darkest day of the year. Ancient Germanic tribes celebrated the winter solstice by bringing evergreens into their homes as a symbol of the returning light and the coming spring."

The village's waterfront is lined with the traditional fishermen's cabins called rorbu or rorbuer, which are mostly red in colour, as seen in today's image. Once important to fishermen, these cabins have now become a popular pick for tourist rentals. In 1999, German painter Ingo Kühl set up a pop-up studio in a rorbu in Reine, where he painted scenes of the harbour framed by the towering mountain range. This village truly shines in winter, when you have the chance to see the northern lights twinkling in the night sky."

The area around the lake is known for its beneficial climate, especially for those with respiratory conditions. Its crystal-clear waters and surrounding hotels provide a perfect getaway for up to 500 visitors. The lake played a role in the 1956 Winter Olympics, where it hosted speed skating events on natural ice, and it has even been immortalised in a pop song by singer Claudio Baglioni. With astounding views, mythical roots and activities for every season, this lake may well be the Dolomites' most alluring reflection."

Founded by ornithologist Frank Chapman as an eco-friendly twist on holiday hunting parties, this annual event replaced shotguns with binoculars. Since then, it has become one of the world's longest-running citizen science projects. Every year from December 14 to January 5, volunteers of all ages and birding skill levels come together to survey designated areas called 'circles.' Each circle has a diameter of approximately 24 kilometres, and participants count every bird they see or hear within it. The result is a colossal snapshot of bird diversity, with data collected from over 2,500 locations each season. It's a serious effort to track changes in bird populations, providing valuable data for scientists working to protect vulnerable species."

        "description": "Here's the red poinsettia, one of the plants synonymous with the holiday season across North America. With its striking star-shaped leaves, the poinsettia has become a symbol of Christmas cheer, brightening homes and public spaces during winter. National Poinsettia Day in the United States celebrates the legacy of Joel Roberts Poinsett, the first US ambassador to Mexico, who introduced these vibrant plants to America in the 1820s. He discovered them while exploring the Taxco region in Guerrero and, so taken by their beauty, sent clippings back to his home in Charleston, South Carolina."

Among them are the Tre Cime di Lavaredo, or the 'Three Peaks of Lavaredo,' seen on the right in today's image. A part of the Sexten Dolomites in northeastern Italy, they're one of the most famous mountain groups in the Alps. These three peaks—Cima Grande, Cima Ovest and Cima Piccola—are a UNESCO World Heritage Site that captivates adventurers and nature lovers alike. During World War I, the front line between Italy and Austria-Hungary cut through the peaks, leaving the area with many remnants of the conflict, such as fortifications, trenches, tunnels and commemorative plaques."

Since ancient Greek times, when it was known as 'Belerion' or 'Place of the Sun' or in Arthurian legends about the lost land of Lyonesse, Land's End has always been a place of fascination. Land's End is the most south-westerly point on mainland Britain. It is famous for being the starting point or end of charity races which run the length of the island of Great Britain from Land's End to John O'Groats at Britain's north-easterly tip."

        "description": "Prick up your ears and stretch your neck—let's step into the world of guanacos. These creatures, part of the same family as camels, alpacas and llamas, are native to the rugged landscapes of South America. Standing around 110 centimetres tall and weighing up to 90 kilograms, guanacos travel in herds led by a dominant male, accompanied by females and their young. After a gestation period of around 11 months, females give birth to a single baby—known as a chulengo—which is able to stand and walk within an hour of birth. Their diet, consisting of grasses, shrubs and lichens, enables them to flourish in harsh, mountainous terrain. Guanaco's soft, warm fur—first introduced for textile use in the mid-1900s—is highly prized. It is used to create luxury fabrics and is valued second only to vicuña wool across the Americas."

Built between the 12th and 13th centuries on the Île de la Cité—an island in the Seine—Notre-Dame has witnessed centuries of French history, from the Hundred Years' War to the French Revolution, and beyond. Although it was chosen by Napoleon as the site of his coronation as emperor in 1804, by the early 19th century, the cathedral was in a state of disrepair. However, one novel changed its fortunes: 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame' by Victor Hugo. The popularity of this book helped encourage a restoration project that renewed the cathedral's former beauty."

Together, they hold 21% of the world's fresh surface water. Of these, Lake Ontario, standing between the states of Ontaio and New York, has the smallest surface area and was named 'Ontario' by Europeans in 1641. Covering approximately 18,960 square kilometres, it has been an important waterway for centuries. By the 18th century, the lake had become a strategic hub for the fur trade, particularly during the French and Indian War and later the War of 1812. Today, historic forts like Fort Niagara and Fort Henry stand as reminders of these turbulent times near the lake."

However, during the Russian revolutions of 1917, Finnish nationalists saw their chance to establish an independent nation. After several months of negotiations, Finland declared independence on December 6."

While these towers can be found in various locations, today's image highlights them at Mono Lake in Mono County, California. These stunning structures form when calcium-rich fresh water from several creeks and streams flows into the lake, mixing with its alkaline waters. Over centuries, this interaction causes calcium carbonate to accumulate, gradually creating tufa spires that rise above the lake’s surface."
