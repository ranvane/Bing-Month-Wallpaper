        "description": "Happy New Year's Day! Humans have celebrated the new year since at least 2000 BCE, but various cultures have chosen different days coinciding with equinoxes or lunar cycles. The Romans established January 1 as the beginning of the year in 153 BCE, but this fell out of favour throughout Europe during the medieval era. Since 1582 and the widespread adoption of the Gregorian calendar, however, much of the world now celebrates the new year today. In addition to watching fireworks, drinking champagne and making resolutions in the wee hours of the morning, other global traditions include making noise, eating lucky foods and giving gifts."

Many countries celebrate with foods symbolic of prosperity, long life and good fortune for the coming year, and many people sing Scottish folk song 'Auld Lang Syne' at the stroke of midnight to remember old friends and past experiences. The new year is often personified as a baby, a tradition that dates back to ancient Greeks, often paired with an old man who represents the previous year."

Covering more than 150 square kilometres, it's one of the state's oldest national parks. As you follow the winding road up through the park, you'll see a whole range of landscapes, from temperate rainforests full of some of the world's tallest eucalyptus trees to alpine moorland. These ever-changing views are what give the park its nickname, 'the park for all seasons.' One of the park's must-visit sites is Russell Falls, a three-tiered waterfall that plunges over 55 metres."

Built during the 9th century in the reign of the Shailendra dynasty—an influential ruling family in Southeast Asia—it's the world's largest Buddhist temple, standing tall on the island of Java, Indonesia. This ancient sanctum has withstood centuries of natural challenges, including volcanic eruptions and earthquakes, thanks to its advanced interlocking stone system. Historically, Borobudur was an important pilgrimage site. The structure is divided into three sections: the base has detailed carvings that teach moral lessons; the middle level consists of five square terraces with reliefs depicting daily life and historical events; and the upper levels are three circular platforms with 72 stupas—mound-like structures containing Buddha statues."

Translating to 'Sea of Milk,' it is a spectacular four-tiered waterfall on the Mandovi River. Legend has it, a beautiful princess would take a bath here and then drink sweetened milk from a golden jug. One day she saw a handsome prince watching her. To protect her modesty, she poured the milk, forming a white curtain as a shield. According to the tale, the milk continues to flow down the mountains as a tribute to her grace and virtue. This gem in the Western Ghats marks the journey of the Mandovi River as it falls toward Panaji and finally meets the Arabian Sea. During the dry season, the falls might seem unassuming, but with the arrival of the monsoon, they transform into a magnificent cascade of thundering water."

This over 2-kilometre lake, surrounded by the snow-dusted Julian Alps, was formed over 14,000 years ago through glacial and tectonic activity. The first signs of settlement on Bled Island date back to the New Stone Age (10,000 BCE to 3,000 BCE). Additionally, archaeologists uncovered an Early Medieval graveyard here from the 9th century CE. Today, it houses the Church of the Assumption—built in its current form near the end of the 17th century—where visitors ring the 'wishing bell' for good luck."

In the past, it was customary for the wealthy to give boxes filled with gifts to their servants on the day after Christmas. The tradition evolved into a day for charitable giving to the less fortunate. Today, while the spirit of giving remains, it has transformed into a holiday enjoying bustling sales and a lineup of soccer matches. However, December 26th in India is marked by a more somber remembrance—the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami, which is why the disaster is often referred to as the 'Boxing Day Tsunami.'"

For many, it's a celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ, bringing family and friends together to exchange gifts, share meals and enjoy festive décor. Beyond its spiritual roots, Christmas also lights up the season with beloved customs—decorating trees, carolling and eagerly awaiting Santa's arrival. Recognised as a state holiday in India, Christmas is celebrated as a secular occasion. For Christians, particularly Catholics, attending Midnight Mass is a key tradition. Many Christian households adorn their homes with cribs, trees and brightly lit stars symbolising the Bethlehem star. They also share sweets and cakes with neighbours. In northern and north-western regions, it's known as Bada Din (Big Day), and some communities mark the occasion by planting trees."

Originally built in 500 CE to replace an earlier monument commissioned by Emperor Ashoka in 249 BCE, it holds a legacy as rich as its carvings. With a solid base of 28 metres in diameter and a towering height of 43.6 metres, it merges stone and brick in a design that's both massive and intricate. The lower stonework boasts delicate floral carvings from the Gupta era, while its walls feature finely detailed depictions of humans, birds and inscriptions in the ancient Brahmi script. Although the stupa has been expanded six times over the centuries, the upper section remains unfinished. Standing before it, one can't help but marvel at the stories it holds."

This has been an important event for millennia, with evidence of celebrations going back as far as 10,000 BCE. Some of the world's most famous Stone Age monuments, including Stonehenge, are aligned with the point that the sun rises or sets on the winter solstice. Traditionally, it was a time for feasting and lighting of fires to symbolise the darkest day of the year. Ancient Germanic tribes celebrated the winter solstice by bringing evergreens into their homes as a symbol of the returning light and the coming spring."

Set on Christmas Eve, it follows a young girl named Clara, who goes on an adventure with the Nutcracker Prince as they battle the evil Mouse King. Many renowned ballet companies present their rendition of this classic every year, including the New York City Ballet, the Boston Ballet and the English National Ballet, pictured here. Tchaikovsky's score is noted for its use of the celesta, an instrument with a bell-like tone, which perfectly captures the fairy-tale atmosphere."

The village's waterfront is lined with the traditional fishermen's cabins called rorbu or rorbuer, which are mostly red in colour, as seen in today's image. Once important to fishermen, these cabins have now become a popular pick for tourist rentals. In 1999, German painter Ingo Kühl set up a pop-up studio in a rorbu in Reine, where he painted scenes of the harbour framed by the towering mountain range. This village truly shines in winter, when you have the chance to see the northern lights twinkling in the night sky."

Its crystal-clear waters and surrounding hotels provide a perfect getaway for up to 500 visitors.

        "description": "Here's the red poinsettia, one of the plants from the spurge family, Euphorbiaceae. With its striking star-shaped leaves, the poinsettia has become a symbol of Christmas cheer, brightening homes and public spaces during winter. The history of the poinsettia can be traced back to ancient civilisations. The Aztecs, who called it cuetlaxóchitl, used it to make a reddish-purple dye and to treat fevers. But the plant's association with Christmas has roots in Mexican tradition, where it's known as 'la flor de Nochebuena' or 'Holy Night flower.' According to legend, a young girl, unable to afford a gift for Baby Jesus, was inspired to offer humble weeds, which miraculously transformed into the vibrant poinsettias we know today."

Among them are the Tre Cime di Lavaredo, or the 'Three Peaks of Lavaredo,' seen on the right in today's image. A part of the Sexten Dolomites in northeastern Italy, they're one of the most famous mountain groups in the Alps. These three peaks—Cima Grande, Cima Ovest and Cima Piccola—are a UNESCO World Heritage Site that captivates adventurers and nature lovers alike. Much like these, India's northern region is home to awe-inspiring mountain ranges like the Himalayas and Karakoram. In these mountains you'll find some of the tallest peaks on the planet, including Mount Kangchenjunga, which holds the title of the world's third-highest peak."

Land's End is the most south-westerly point on mainland Britain. It is most famous for being the starting point or end of charity races which run the length of the island of Great Britain from Land's End to John O'Groats - at Britain's north-easterly tip."

They are a fascinating camelid native to South America, and they're the wild cousin of the llama! Unlike llamas, guanacos sport a more uniform coat colour, usually a warm light brown to dark cinnamon, with a white underside, a grey face and small, straight ears. They can live up to 28 years in the wild, making them some of the longest-living land mammals of their size in South America. Guanacos are one of the continent's largest land animals today, sharing their megafauna status with South American giants like tapirs, marsh deer and jaguars. Guanacos munch on grasses, shrubs and even cacti, using a fascinating digestive process like, but distinct from, ruminants."

Built between the 12th and 13th centuries on the Île de la Cité—an island in the Seine—Notre-Dame has witnessed centuries of French history, from the Hundred Years' War to the French Revolution, and beyond. Although it was chosen by Napoleon as the site of his coronation as emperor in 1804, by the early 19th century, the cathedral was in a state of disrepair. However, one novel changed its fortunes: 'The Hunchback of Notre-Dame' by Victor Hugo. The popularity of this book helped encourage a restoration project that renewed the cathedral's former beauty."

The Jahangir Mahal was crafted in 1605 by Bir Singh Deo, specifically to impress the Mughal Emperor Jahangir, who stayed as the Maharaja's guest for just one night."

However, during the Russian revolutions of 1917, Finnish nationalists saw their chance to establish an independent nation. After several months of negotiations, Finland declared independence on December 6."

While these towers can be found in many places, today's image showcases them at Mono Lake in Mono County, California, United States. These structures develop when calcium-rich fresh water, flowing into the lake from several creeks and streams, mixes with the lake's alkaline water. Over centuries, this interaction caused calcium carbonate to build up, forming tufa spires above the lake's surface. To preserve the tufa towers, the Mono Lake Tufa State Natural Reserve was established in 1981 by the California State Legislature."

Today, however, the country observes Navy Day on 4 December in honour of Operation Trident, a pivotal mission in which the Indian Navy launched a powerful strike, sinking four Pakistani vessels, including the PNS Khaibar, and secured a crucial victory over the Pakistan Navy."

Within the regal walls of this fort lies the Sattais Katcheri, which means the 'court of 27 pillars,' featured in today's image. Amber Fort was built in 1592, and it served as the residence of the Maharajas, or rulers, of the area. Famous for its unique blend of Hindu, Rajput and Mughal architectural styles, it is constructed from pale yellow and pink sandstone alongside white marble."

Male moose are called bulls, females are known as cows and their young are referred to as calves. One thing that really sets moose apart is their incredible antlers, which are only sported by the males."
