        "description": "Mardi Gras, or 'Fat Tuesday,' is a vibrant tradition that marks the last day of indulgence before the Christian season of Lent begins on Ash Wednesday. Rooted in ancient Roman celebrations like Saturnalia, Mardi Gras evolved as Christianity spread, blending local customs—most notably Carnival festivities—with religious observances. The name itself originates from French, with the word gras meaning 'fat,' referring to rich, fatty foods like meat, eggs, and cheese that are traditionally enjoyed before the fasting season begins."

Known for its dramatic cliffs, dense rainforests, and cascading waterfalls, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is a treasure trove of natural beauty and biodiversity. Among the most iconic features of the Blue Mountains region are the eucalyptus trees, pictured here. Home to 92 species of eucalyptus, this area offers visitors a chance to marvel at these resilient trees, which are central to Australian wildlife. Their aromatic leaves provide food for koalas, while their bark and canopy create habitats for countless birds and insects."
