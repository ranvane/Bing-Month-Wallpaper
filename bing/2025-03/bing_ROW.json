        "description": "Jackson Square, in the French Quarter of New Orleans, Louisiana, featured in today's image, has a rich history dating back to the early 1800s. Originally known Place d'Armes and later Plaza de Armas under Spanish rule, it served a key site for military parades and public executions in the 18th and 19th centuries. After the 1815 Battle of New Orleans, the former military plaza was renamed Jackson Square in honour of Andrew Jackson, the hero of the battle and the seventh president of the United States."

        "description": "Today's image features the southern yellow-billed hornbill, a bird found throughout Southern Africa and commonly spotted in Kruger National Park in South Africa. This medium-sized bird measures about 48 to 50 centimetres in length with a wingspan of 60 centimetres and weighs 150 to 200 grams. Recognisable by its bright yellow, curved bill, this bird is often seen hopping on the ground in search of food. Its diet includes insects, seeds, fruits, berries, nuts and small reptiles, making it a key player in the ecosystem as both a predator and seed disperser. Social creatures, these hornbills are usually found in pairs or small groups, often foraging together. They nest in natural tree cavities, with the female sealing herself inside using a mud wall, leaving only a small slit through which the male feeds her and the chicks. Their calls—whistling, grunting and cackling—echo across the savannah."

        "description": "Today, we are in New South Wales, Australia, amid the Blue Mountains National Park. Known for its dramatic cliffs, dense rainforests and cascading waterfalls, this UNESCO World Heritage Site is a treasure trove of natural beauty and biodiversity. Among the most iconic features of the Blue Mountains region are the eucalyptus trees, pictured here. Home to 92 species of eucalyptus, this area offers visitors a chance to marvel at these resilient trees, which are central to Australian wildlife. Their aromatic leaves provide food for koalas, while their bark and canopy create habitats for countless birds and insects. Also nestled within the mountains is the Megalong Valley."

In Canada, one such place sits deep in Jasper National Park, Alberta, where the 22-kilometre-long, winding Maligne Lake cuts through the mountains. It is the largest natural lake in the Canadian Rockies, where towering peaks, glacial waters and endless sky come together."
