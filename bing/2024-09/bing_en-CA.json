        "description": "What's the perfect thing to do under the midnight sun? If you're a walrus like the ones in today's image, the answer might be taking a quick dip with your crew, chowing down on clams and mussels and then sunbathing on a beach or ice floe. Welcome to Svalbard, an archipelago in the Arctic Ocean halfway between Norway and the North Pole. Photographed in the waters of Spitsbergen, the largest of the archipelago's nine islands, these aquatic mammals are year-round residents that are often found in male or female herds. Male walruses can be almost 4 metres long and weigh more than 1,200 kilograms, and during mating season, they use this girth to fight among themselves for dominance over groups of females, called harems."

Constructed between 1631 and 1687, the church was a votive offering for the city's deliverance from a devastating plague in 1630. Built at the entrance to the Grand Canal, its dome dominates the Venice skyline, as seen in today's image. Italian architect Baldassare Longhena envisioned this structure at the age of 26, and it became his lifelong project, which was completed after his death. The exterior of the church, with its volutes—spiral, scroll-like ornaments—and statues contrasts with the spacious octagonal interior adorned with works by Renaissance artists like Titian and Tintoretto. Each November, Venice commemorates the church's significance during the Festa della Madonna della Salute, a cultural celebration that includes festive processions and offering of candles in gratitude for deliverance from the plague."

Named after the American Civil War general William Tecumseh Sherman, it's not only tall but is also more than 11 metres wide. Visitors flock to capture moments among these ancient giants, whose reddish-brown, fibrous bark and wide-reaching branches evoke a sense of living history."

Weighing 14 to 45 kilograms, they're expert foragers, diving to the seabed to find food. These clever critters are smart as well as cute: they use rocks to crack open shellfish, making them one of the few animals that use tools. There used to be as many as 300,000 in the wild, but they were heavily hunted for almost two centuries, as their dense fur was highly prized."

The September equinox marks the transition from the lush summer to the mellow fall in the Northern Hemisphere, while in the Southern Hemisphere, it signals the beginning of spring. The term 'equinox' is derived from Latin, meaning 'equal night.' During this moment, the Earth's axis is perpendicular to the sun, meaning it rises due east and sets due west, a rare moment of global balance. This balance occurs because the Earth's axis is neither tilted toward nor away from the sun."

The origin of this holiday goes back to a 1995 joke between two friends, John Baur and Mark Summers. During a racquetball game, one of them exclaimed 'Aaarrr!' in response to an injury, and the concept of a day dedicated to pirate lingo was born. Initially an inside joke, Talk Like a Pirate Day gained popularity after the duo shared the idea with humourist Dave Barry in 2002, who promoted it in his syndicated column. Since then, it's become a day of fun and parodic celebration—people don pirate costumes, engage in pirate-themed activities, like the kid on the ship in today's image, and embrace mock pirate language. Whether ye be a seasoned buccaneer or a greenhorn, today be for all to enjoy. So, batten down the hatches, set sail and remember: on this day, everyone can be a pirate."

Originally constructed in 1559, this castle has witnessed centuries of Japanese history, including the rise and fall of powerful clans. It was torn down during the tumultuous Meiji Restoration—the period that marked the return of imperial power in the country— but was rebuilt in 1933. The castle seen in today's image is a unique wooden reconstruction, a rarity among Japan's often concrete-rebuilt castles. This five-story structure, which includes a museum, offers a glimpse into feudal Japan while providing stunning views of the valley below. In addition to the castle, the city of Gujō is also famous for hosting the Gujō Odori, one of Japan's oldest dance festivals. Held annually from mid-July to early September, the festival sees locals and tourists alike dancing through the night in the castle town, preserving a tradition that dates back more than 400 years."

These marsupials, smaller cousins of the kangaroo, are native to Australia and New Guinea. Wallabies have around 30 different species, including brush wallabies, rock-wallabies, hare-wallabies, nail-tail wallabies and swamp wallabies. These agile and sprightly mammals are herbivores, nibbling on grasses, leaves and fruits. With a height of 30 to 105 centimetres, wallabies have strong hind legs that help them take impressive leaps and serve as a defence against predators. During mating season, male wallabies engage in boxing bouts to show dominance in an attempt to grab females' attention. Social creatures, wallabies form small groups called 'mobs,' which provide safety and mutual grooming. Their playgrounds are forests that echo with the thudding of their hops as they navigate their home range with ease."

        "description": "Amidst the whispering woods and rustling leaves, you might catch a glimpse of the red fox—a creature as clever as it is charming. What truly captivates are moments like the one in today's image, which shows a tender nuzzle between a red fox mother and her kit somewhere in the Canadian countryside. With its vivid auburn coat and a bushy tail often tipped in white, this animal is a familiar sight across much of the Northern Hemisphere. Agile, adaptable and mostly nocturnal, it roams from dense forests to urban playgrounds."

        "description": "Today's image features the Vasco da Gama Bridge in Portugal, which looks like a sleek line cutting through Lisbon's skyline. Up close, it is a cable-stayed bridge with viaducts, stretching across the Tagus River in Parque das Nações, a civil parish in Lisbon. The second longest bridge in Europe, it also holds the title of being the longest in the European Union. Built to ease the traffic jam on Lisbon's 25 de Abril Bridge and make travel smoother between the north and south of Portugal, the construction of the Vasco da Gama Bridge began in February 1995. It is earthquake-resistant, designed to absorb shifting during a quake. Since its deck is not fixed to the pylons, it can move both lengthwise and sideways. Inaugurated on March 29, 1998, the bridge's opening was perfectly timed for Expo 98, the World's Fair celebrating the 500th anniversary of Vasco da Gama's historic sea route discovery from Europe to India."

The name 'Iguazu' comes from words in the regional languages Guarani or Tupi, which mean 'big water.' These series of waterfalls are formed by the Iguazu River, on the border between Argentina's Misiones province and Brazil's Paraná state. They feature a striking staircase formation, with a two-step cascade created by three layers of basalt."

These words by former secretary-general of the United Nations Kofi Annan capture the essence of International Literacy Day, celebrated every September 8. Established by UNESCO in 1966, this observance not only celebrates those who can read but also highlights the ongoing battle against illiteracy. With approximately 775 million people worldwide still lacking basic literacy, this day resonates powerfully within the hallowed walls of the Stockholm Public Library in Sweden, or 'Stadsbiblioteket' as it is known to locals, featured in today's image."

Hummingbirds are known for their incredible speed; they can flap their wings up to 80 times per second, allowing them to hover in place and even fly backwards. Their high metabolism requires them to eat constantly, so they spend their days flitting from flower to flower, sipping nectar and catching insects. Fun fact: these birds can remember every flower they've visited and how long it will take a flower to refill with nectar."

These primarily nocturnal raptors were photographed in Pakistan but can also be found in the forests and scrublands across South and Southeast Asia. An impressive wingspan of 48-53 centimetres, piercing yellow eyes and exceptional hearing help them catch small mammals and birds with precision in dim light. Measuring up to 0.6 metres tall, these feathered predators can also be spotted hunting in the daytime when the weather is cloudy. They often live in the abandoned nests of other birds or in natural crevices. Dusky eagle-owls breed in December and January, usually rearing their young in the safety of tall trees or cliff ledges. Nature lovers and bird watchers are captivated by their solemn gaze and elegant stature."

Pictured in today's image, Crystal Lake is one such protected area. Located in the Alpine Lakes Wilderness in Washington, the Enchantments has more than 700 lakes and ponds and some of the best rock climbing in the Western United States. It's also home to mountain goats, ptarmigan, pikas and numerous types of alpine flowers. If you want to see Alpine Lakes Wilderness yourself, however, be prepared to wait. Few permits are granted for day hikes, and of the 40,000 people who entered last year's lottery for overnight permits, only 2,558 received one."

The 120-kilometre-long river intricately carves its way through valleys before converging with the Bow River in Calgary, at an elevation of 1,040 metres. Along the river's course is Elbow Falls—a series of cascading waterfalls—that creates a natural spectacle. In winter, the falls transform into an icy wonderland while summer brings a rush of whitewater, which is ideal for rafting, kayaking, fishing, hiking and other recreational activities."

As the longest river entirely in England, the Thames has been a silent witness to time's dance, from Roman conquests to Shakespearean dramas on its banks. Over the centuries, kings and queens have weathered its tides, with the iconic Tower of London standing sentinel along its banks. Starting in Gloucestershire and winding through cities like Oxford, Windsor, and in today's image, London, it flows for 346 kilometres before merging with the North Sea. With a range of freshwater and near seawater habitats, the river is a haven for an array of wildlife like mute swans and bottlenose dolphins. It also flanks several Sites of Special Scientific Interest. With every ebb and flow, the Thames invites us on a journey through time, a fluid chronicle of England's enduring saga."
