        "description": "Beech trees are pretty amazing. There are several species worldwide, but the European beech steals the spotlight in much of Europe. With its smooth grey bark, short trunk and sweeping branches, this tree is a standout in Belgium's forests, as shown in today's image. It grows in temperate regions and prefers well-drained, fertile soils, taking up to 30 years to mature. Not only do these 48-metre-tall trees dominate the landscape, but their wood is also used to make some of the sturdiest furniture, flooring and even kitchen tools."

These striking animals, known for their unique black and white patterns, are mostly found in the African savannah, stretching from Kenya to South Africa. Of the three zebra species—Grévy's zebra, plains zebra and mountain zebra—the Grévy's zebra is the most endangered, with more than half its population lost in only three decades. While plains zebras are thriving, mountain zebras face significant threats, such as poaching and habitat encroachment. Zebras play an essential role in the ecosystems they live in, coexisting with predators like lions and hyenas while shaping the grasslands they call home."

Steeped in thousands of years of tradition, this holiday marks the start of the lunisolar Chinese calendar. One of the most captivating images associated with this festival is the dragon dance, pictured here. This is a mesmerising performance where skilled dancers manipulate a long, flexible dragon puppet, bringing it to life with sinuous, undulating movements. The dragon, a symbol of power, dignity and good fortune, is believed to bring luck to the community, with longer dragons bringing even more prosperity."

This raptor belongs to the genus Asio, whose members are characterised by feather tufts ('ears') on their heads. The short-eared owl only reveals its tufts when feeling defensive."

It was also a hub of the spice trade, connecting distant regions like China, Egypt, Greece and India.

Today's image features a Eurasian red squirrel, photographed in the Netherlands. The red squirrel can be found across Europe and Russia, from western Spain and Portugal all the way to eastern Siberia. Their diet mainly consists of nuts, fungi, seeds and berries, but they will occasionally eat birds' eggs. In addition to being the national mammal of Denmark, they also play a part in old Norse mythology. Ratatoskr is a red squirrel who scurries up and down Yggdrasil, the sacred tree, carrying messages and spreading gossip."

Its iconic Moorish castle ruins and the 15th-century tower reflect its history as a medieval fortress. Fun fact: Many people thought the name Zahara de la Sierra came from azahar, the Arabic word for citrus blossom. However, studies suggest it actually comes from sahra, which means wild or barren land, reflecting the rocky hill where the village is located. As part of Andalusia's famous Route of the White Villages, Zahara de la Sierra promises unforgettable experiences in one of Spain's most beautiful corners."

Although it's the smallest of the eight pelican species worldwide, it's still a large bird, measuring about 1.2 metres in length and having a wingspan of over 1.5 metres. The brown pelican is a piscivore, meaning its diet mainly consists of fish. Dixon Lanier Merritt's limerick famously begins, 'A wonderful bird is the pelican; his bill can hold more than his belly can,' and it's spot on—its pouch can store up to three times the volume of its stomach. This versatile feature acts as a scoop, a tool for cooling off during hot weather and a feeding trough for young pelicans. The brown pelican faced near extinction twice, first due to hunting and later from the impact of pesticides like DDT. Today, it's an Endangered Species Act and Environmental Protection Agency success story."

This land owes its formations to an ancient volcanic eruption that occurred 23 million years ago. The fiery beginnings made towering spires, cliffs and talus caves—created by falling boulders wedged into narrow canyons. Over millennia, tectonic forces shifted the landmass northward, leaving the park far from its volcanic birthplace. Talk about a journey!"

Even after most of the world switched to the Gregorian calendar in 1582, some Welsh communities clung to their old ways. Traditionally, the day involves children going door-to-door, singing songs and offering good wishes in exchange for gifts like coins, food or sweets. A unique feature is its clove-decorated apples. These aren't for snacking, though; they're miniature symbols of luck and prosperity."

        "description": "Say hello to the crescent-tail bigeye, a fish as eye-catching as its name suggests. With large, wide eyes and a distinctive tail shaped like a crescent moon, it's hard to miss. Measuring 45–50 centimetres long, it has a sleek body and a protruding lower jaw with small conical teeth. Its eyes are adapted to the low-light conditions of deep waters, helping it spot prey and avoid predators. This fish mainly feeds on smaller fish, crustaceans and invertebrates, fuelling its active lifestyle as it patrols the reefs and hunts for food."

        "description": "An imperial city in northern central Morocco, Meknes is steeped in history. Meknes reflects the Moroccan style of architecture, with one of its most impressive landmarks being Heri es-Swani, seen in today's image. Heri es-Swani was originally constructed as a stable and for storing vast amounts of grain to sustain the settlement and the Sultan's armies. Its design was both practical and impressive—thick walls and an innovative cooling system helped maintain the food supply. Twenty-two rows of symmetrical arches divided the space into corridors that used to have vaulted ceilings. Back then, mules climbed onto the roof terrace to deliver grain, which was then dropped through specially designed holes in the ceiling below. The structure housed more than 12,000 horses. Today, it stands as an empty shell, acting as a scenic backdrop ready to be explored."

Created in 1972, Abraham Lake is a man-made reservoir that spans more than 50 square kilometres along the North Saskatchewan River. Thanks to glacier-fed waters from the Rocky Mountains, the lake stays transparent even in the coldest months. The glacial meltwater carries fine sediment that scatters sunlight, while natural filtration through rocks keeps pollutants to a minimum."

Welcome to the Namib desert, spanning thousands of kilometres across Namibia. Estimated to be 55 million years old, it is believed to be the oldest desert in the world. At the heart of this vast, arid expanse is Sossusvlei, seen in today's image. A salt and clay pan surrounded by towering dunes, Sossusvlei tells a story of contrasts. Every 10 years or so, an extraordinary event occurs when the Tsauchab River floods the pan, transforming it into a stunning turquoise lake. From the adaptable gemsboks to the ingenious Namib desert beetle that drinks fog droplets that collect on its back, the Namib is brimming with stories of survival and resilience."

Stretching more than 20,900 kilometres and dating back thousands of years, the ancient marvel in today's picture is a series of fortifications spanning rugged mountains, valleys and deserts. Featuring steep trenches and watchtowers, parts of it were designed to keep invaders at bay. Hiking the Great Wall offers a unique glimpse into this historical landmark. The experience varies from well-preserved sections like Mutianyu to wild, unrestored parts such as Jiankou. The Great Wall of China isn't just a wall, but a symbol of perseverance and strength."

The Moeraki Boulders, some of which are over two metres in diameter, have been shaped by nature over millions of years. Each boulder started as a pebble on the seabed around 65 million years ago. Over time, layers of mud and silt built up around them, cemented together by calcite. Thanks to erosion and the movement of the sea, the boulders eventually emerged. According to local Māori legends, the Moeraki Boulders are remnants of eel baskets, calabashes and kūmara that washed ashore from the wreck of Āraiteuru, a great sailing canoe."

This Romanesque church, originally built in 450 CE, features a sturdy square bell tower added in the 9th century, enhancing the basilica's exterior. Its design features three naves, divided into two rows of 12 columns each. Featured in today's image is the basilica's real showstopper: the basement crypt, or burial chamber is a stunning model of early religious design. Complete with vaulted ceilings that slope down into rows of stone columns, its floor is a work of art itself. It's inlaid with beautifully intricate mosaic tiles that have withstood the test of time."

Historically, Pushkaranis were built for ritualistic temple practices or as royal amenities during the Vijayanagara Empire. In Hampi, almost every grand temple has one tank, serving both spiritual and functional purposes. The Pushkarani in front of the Sri Krishna Temple, seen in today's image, is one of the most elegant and accessible tanks here."

        "description": "Welcome to a spot where rivers meet borders in the most stunning way: Bản Giốc – Detian Falls, featured in today's image. Tucked between the karst hills of Daxin County in China and Trùng Khánh district in Vietnam, these falls tumble along the Quây Sơn River. Over 25 metres tall and more than 80 metres wide, it holds the distinction of being the widest waterfall in Vietnam. Located over 270 kilometres north of Hanoi, the waterfalls have gradually worn away their crest over the years, inching upstream. For most of the year, they flow as two distinct cascades, but come summer, when the rains swell the river, they merge into one big fall. Even with better roads, easier public transport and drone videos showing off the jaw-dropping beauty of the falls, Bản Giốc remains refreshingly off the beaten path. Mass tourism hasn't caught up yet, and on most weekdays, you'll find only a handful of visitors—just you, the locals and the sound of cascading water."

Today, on Tolkien Day, fans around the world honour the master storyteller who crafted the epic adventures of Middle-earth: J.R.R. Tolkien. While Tolkien may have started the tale, it's his readers who carry it forward, generation after generation, diving into the pages of 'The Hobbit,' 'The Lord of the Rings' and beyond. For today's featured image, it is only fitting to visit a place that might have inspired the literary legend: the Radcliffe Camera, or Rad Cam, at the University of Oxford in England."

This picturesque village, starring in today's image, showcases the rich traditions and unique language of Switzerland's Romansh-speaking communities. Its homes are adorned with sgraffiti—decorative designs etched into plaster—and colourful murals, both iconic art styles of the Engadin region. Dating back to 840, when it was first referred to as Ardezis, the village's history includes Steinsberg Castle, originally owned by the Bishop of Chur. Though destroyed during the Swabian War in 1499, the castle's tower has been restored multiple times and stands today as a proud reminder of its past. In 1975, Ardez was chosen as a Swiss model village for its exceptional preservation efforts, which have kept its historic charm intact."
