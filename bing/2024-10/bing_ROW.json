        "description": "If you're looking for a Halloween destination that combines history with a hefty dose of hauntings, Edinburgh Castle in Scotland, is the place to be. Positioned high on an extinct volcano, these fortress walls have seen wars, royal births, executions and plenty of other drama since the 11th century. What really sets it apart is its reputation as one of Scotland's most haunted spots. It's no surprise that with more than 1,000 years of history, some have reported ghost sightings."

As the country's first national park, it represents a conservation success story, where the once-endangered ibex now thrives alongside chamois, marmots and eagles. The landscape changes with elevation, featuring rolling meadows adorned with wildflowers and moss-covered rocks that give way to rugged peaks, the ideal challenge for climbers. Skirting the borders of Piedmont and the Aosta Valley, the park attracts those eager for wildlife photography, hiking and the serenity of alpine air. It is not only a refuge for animals but also a living museum of alpine culture."

On Samhain, the Celtic precursor to Halloween, the owl was believed to be the kin of roaming spirits."

With their thick fur and a generous layer of fat, polar bears perfectly adapt to cold environments."

The salty sea air from the Baltic Sea and the moist climate contribute to the trees' distorted shapes, giving rise to the forest's haunted moniker. Visitors experience light-hearted brushes with the supernatural, such as the crunch of dead leaves, a friendly spirit waving hello from afar or a mischievous ghost peeking from behind a tree. The strategic lighting, which casts ghostly shadows, along with the sculptures and decorations placed along the path, are elements that enhance the forest's ghostly aura throughout the year."

It has been a rite of passage for mountaineers since the first recorded ascent in 1786. If scaling the peak isn't your thing, don't worry—the Aiguille du Midi cable car takes you up to 3,842 metres, almost to the top. While skiing and snowboarding on Mont Blanc's slopes is the go-to in winter, summer turns the area into a hiking and trail-running haven."

When large deposits of gold were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay."

Madame Sherri's dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalised. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back. A fire destroyed the house in 1963, leaving behind only the stone foundation, an iconic staircase and a large fireplace leading to a lone chimney."

The park's centrepiece, seen in today's image, is the 160-hectare mill pond, a favourite spot for fishing and canoeing. Out of its waters grow pond cypress and bald cypress trees, two varieties that are native to the US. Winding through the park are over 11 kilometres of nature trails, leading visitors through sandy landscapes past a bird sanctuary and tortoise habitat. The hardwood trees here are a haven for woodpeckers and other birds, while the soft soil provides ideal burrowing ground for tortoises. No matter the season, this park promises a peaceful retreat for all."

The three-toed sloth, a laid-back, tree-loving mammal that's right at home in the tropical regions of South and Central America. They have short tails and three clawed toes on each limb, which help them cling onto branches with ease. Sloths are mainly leaf eaters, although they also snack on fruits, and tree sap to keep them going. To help them break down those tough, fibrous leaves, they have a special multi-chambered stomach. With their super slow metabolism, digestion takes its sweet time, and they don't need much food each day to get by. It's not just their stomachs that move at a leisurely pace; they're so slow-moving that algae often develop on their fur, giving a greenish tint, which handily also provides them camouflage."

The Temple of Hathor, the crown jewel of Dendera, featured in today's image, immediately draws visitors' eyes. Its construction started around 54 BCE, under Ptolemy XII, with the majestic hypostyle hall added later during the reign of the Roman emperor Tiberius."

The great migration, considered one of the seven wonders of the natural world, is a safari spectacle where survival is the prize.

Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today."

They typically breed in wooded swamps, shallow lakes, marshes, ponds and creeks throughout the eastern United States, the west coast, parts of southern Canada and Mexico's west coast. Sometimes, they nest as far as a kilometre from their water source."

        "description": "Welcome to the Cape Breton Highlands, where land and sea meet in a dramatic embrace. Today's image features these highlands, which are in the northern part of Cape Breton Island, Nova Scotia, Canada. They form a highland plateau that is part of the Appalachian Mountain chain. The region extends across the north of the counties of Inverness and Victoria and is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the Cabot Strait to the north and east, the Gulf of St. Lawrence to the north and west and Bras d'Or Lake to the south. The landscape is a stunning tapestry of broad, rolling hills interspersed with deep valleys and steep-walled river canyons. In the southern and western parts of the plateau, wide valleys shaped by glacial activity have created some of Cape Breton's most fertile agricultural land. Meanwhile, the interior and southern regions are blanketed in cool, damp deciduous forests, which transform into a vibrant display of autumn colours."

Walking through the age-old cobblestone streets, one can explore the Fortezza Orsini, a fortress-turned-museum that dates to the 11th century. Visitors engage with centuries-old tales of power and defence with each step they take inside the fort. Near Poggio San Rocco and Poggio Croce hills lies a necropolis—a large, ancient burial site—with well-preserved Etruscan tombs that hint at the area's long history. The Etruscan civilisation inhabited this area and flourished in what is now Tuscany and Umbria between the 8th and 3rd centuries BCE."

Found across the western states, especially in Utah and Colorado, these trees are the most widespread native species in North America. Their autumn foliage is breathtaking, with their leaves turning a vibrant yellow that lights up the landscape, as seen in today's photo, which was taken near Marble, Colorado. Aspens are not only beautiful but also biologically fascinating. They grow in large colonies that originate from a single root system, making them some of the largest living organisms on Earth."

        "description": "Today's image features a creature with three hearts and the uncanny ability to change colour at will: the octopus. Octopuses are cephalopods, marine animals like squids and cuttlefish that have tentacles. Among their many species is the mototi octopus, pictured here. It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown colour but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous. But you don't need to worry about running into one, because they tend to be shy and solitary, often hiding in crevices, shells or man-made objects like bottles and cans."

The upper reaches of the gulch lie within the Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument, while today's image showcases its lower sections in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (GCNRA). Established in 1972 and managed by the United States National Park Service, GCNRA is a conservation area that balances recreation and preservation. Unlike national parks that focus primarily on natural preservation, GCNRA offers a variety of facilities, including four public campgrounds, two small airports and several houseboat rental services, making it a popular destination for visitors."

Covering an expansive area of roughly 1,374,700 hectares, Tsavo East is recognised as one of the oldest and largest protected zones in the country. Here, African elephants roam in their natural splendour. These elephants, the largest land mammals, are celebrated for their extraordinary intelligence. Elephants are remarkable in guiding their young through essential skills such as finding water, selecting safe food and navigating complex social dynamics. Through gentle nudging, vocalisations and demonstrations, elephant mothers help their young survive in the wild. Whether you are capturing a splendid sunrise or exploring, Tsavo East is a place where memories are engraved into the soul, where every visit tells a new tale of the wild's untamed beauty."

Located in central California's Sierra Nevada mountain range, the park has been a popular destination for artists, mountaineers, settlers and nature lovers since the mid-1800s. To preserve the area and protect it from logging and overgrazing by cattle, the US Congress designated Yosemite a national park on this day in 1890. It's one of the most visited parks in the United States, with annual attendance exceeding 3 million, and it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
