Also known as 'Deepavali,' the name translates to 'rows (avali) of lights (deepa)' in Sanskrit, capturing the essence of this festival. Widely celebrated across various religions and regions, each has its own origin story. Regardless of the countless narratives and reasons behind the festivities, the central theme remains the triumph of good over evil. For many, Diwali is a homage to Lakshmi, the Hindu goddess of wealth, who is thought to be guided into the homes of devotees by the glow of lights and lamps. The day isn't just about lights and legends—it's also a time for enjoying moments with loved ones, exchanging gifts and sweets, indulging in delicious feasts and dressing up in new outfits. Observed worldwide, its largest celebrations outside of India occur in Leicester, United Kingdom."

The salty sea air from the Baltic Sea and the moist climate contribute to the trees' distorted shapes, giving rise to the forest's haunted moniker. Visitors experience light-hearted brushes with the supernatural, such as the crunch of dead leaves, a friendly spirit waving hello from afar or a mischievous ghost peeking from behind a tree. The strategic lighting, which casts ghostly shadows, along with the sculptures and decorations placed along the path, are elements that enhance the forest's ghostly aura throughout the year."

The site's journey began in 1577, when Guru Ram Das, the fourth Sikh Guru, completed the man-made pool surrounding the temple. Fast forward to 1604, and it was the fifth Guru, Guru Arjan, who placed the sacred Adi Granth within the temple, shaping its spiritual significance. Despite facing destruction multiple times at the hands of Mughal and Afghan invaders, the Sikhs showed resilience, rebuilding the temple each time."

Bodie was named after W.S. Bodey, a prospector who discovered gold but tragically died in a blizzard before seeing the town's rise. When large deposits of gold were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay."

It was once the site of an extravagant house built in the 1930s by Madame Antoinette Sherri, a flamboyant 1920s costume designer known for her lavish parties. Madame Sherri's dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalised. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back. A fire destroyed the house in 1963, leaving behind only the stone foundation, an iconic staircase and a large fireplace leading to a lone chimney."

The park's centrepiece, seen in today's image, is a 1.6-square-kilometre mill pond, a favourite spot for fishing and canoeing. Out of its waters grow pond cypress and bald cypress trees, two varieties that are native to the US. Winding through the park are over 11 kilometres of nature trails, leading visitors through sandy landscapes past a bird sanctuary and tortoise habitat. The hardwood trees here are a haven for woodpeckers and other birds, while the soft soil provides ideal burrowing ground for tortoises. No matter the season, this park promises a peaceful retreat for all."

Situated about 2.5 kilometres southeast of the modern-day town of Dendera, this temple complex is among the best preserved in the country. Once a thriving oasis along the Nile, it was home to thousands at its height, surrounded by a vast mudbrick wall that protected its sacred grounds. The Temple of Hathor, the crown jewel of Dendera, featured in today's image, immediately draws visitors' eyes. Its construction started around 54 BCE, under Ptolemy XII, with the majestic hypostyle hall added later during the reign of the Roman emperor Tiberius. This temple doesn't have a grand colonnade or pylon gateway at its entrance. Instead, an unfinished stone wall surrounds an open courtyard with entrances leading to this massive hall. So, the complex you see today is truly a testament to centuries of history and evolution. Isn't it amazing how much history one place can hold?"

Trees sense the coming of winter not only by temperature, but by the angle at which light from sunrises and sunsets hits their leaves. Because of New York's buildings, the unique interaction of light, shadows and temperatures often results in fall foliage occurring later in the park than the rest of the city."

When Christian forces captured the city in 1248, the Alcázar was almost totally rebuilt in the Mudejar style, which takes inspiration from the intricate patterns and decorative motifs found in Islamic architecture. Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today."

        "description": "Mysore Dasara is Karnataka's grand state festival, celebrated with immense enthusiasm in the city of Mysuru. This 10-day extravaganza kicks off with nine nights of Navaratri, ending on Vijayadashami, which symbolises the triumph of good over evil. Today's image features the centrepiece of this celebration, the majestic Mysuru Palace. This palace is illuminated every night with 100,000 lights from 7 to 10 PM for the duration of the festival. The palace grounds come to life with cultural performances showcasing Karnataka's heritage of dance, music and art. The origins of the festival remain a mystery, but historical evidence points to its celebration during the 14th-15th century by the Vijayanagara kings. Known as Mahanavami at the time, the festival held great significance in the empire."

Walking through the age-old cobblestone streets, one can explore the Fortezza Orsini, a fortress-turned-museum that dates back to the 11th century. Visitors engage with centuries-old tales of power and defence with each step they take inside the fort. Near Poggio San Rocco and Poggio Croce hills lies a necropolis—a large, ancient burial site—with well-preserved Etruscan tombs that hint at the area's long history. The Etruscan civilisation inhabited this area and flourished in what is now Tuscany and Umbria between the 8th and 3rd centuries BCE."

Their fall foliage is breathtaking, with their leaves turning a vibrant yellow that lights up the landscape, as seen in today's photo, which was taken near Marble, Colorado, USA."

        "description": "Today, we celebrate a creature with three hearts and the uncanny ability to change colour at will: the octopus. Octopuses are cephalopods, marine animals like squids and cuttlefish that have tentacles. Among their many species is the mototi octopus, pictured here. It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown colour but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous. But you don't need to worry about running into one, because they tend to be shy and solitary, often hiding in crevices, shells or man-made objects like bottles and cans."

Designed by the Swiss architecture firm Herzog & de Meuron, this concert hall is a modern architectural marvel perched atop an old brick warehouse from 1963. A centrepiece of the new Hafencity development, it's Hamburg's tallest inhabited building—there are 45 luxury apartments on the upper floors—reaching a height of 107 metres. The Elbphilharmonie features three concert venues: the Great Concert Hall, with vineyard-style seating for 2,100, and acoustics designed by renowned Japanese acoustician Yasuhisa Toyota; the Recital Hall, accommodating 550 for recitals, chamber music and jazz; and the Kaistudio, a 170-seat space for educational activities. This fusion of history and innovation at the Elbphilharmonie offers a glimpse into thoughtful and creative architecture."

The upper reaches of the gulch lie within the Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument, while today's image showcases its lower sections in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (GCNRA). Established in 1972 and managed by the United States National Park Service, GCNRA is a conservation area that balances recreation and preservation. Unlike national parks that focus primarily on natural preservation, GCNRA offers a variety of facilities, including four public campgrounds, two small airports and several houseboat rental services, making it a popular destination for visitors."

Through gentle nudging, vocalisations and demonstrations, elephant mothers pass down vital knowledge that helps their young survive in the wild. Sadly, these precious animals face significant threats from habitat loss and poaching. As we admire these majestic creatures and strive to protect them, we can learn valuable lessons about empathy, cooperation and the importance of community."

He is celebrated for his use of nonviolent resistance to spearhead India's successful struggle for independence from British rule. This day is globally recognised as the International Day of Non-Violence by the United Nations. Gandhi Jayanti is marked by prayer services and tributes throughout the country, with special observances at Raj Ghat in New Delhi, the site of his cremation."
