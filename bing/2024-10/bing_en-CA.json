        "description": "Do you sometimes get spooked? If you do, that means you have a healthy sense of fun and fear. And what better day of the year than Halloween to indulge in all things scary? The holiday we know today traces its roots to ancient traditions, including the Celts' Samhain, the Romans' Feralia and medieval Christian observances. Today, costumed people mingle in the streets, not unlike their ancestors who donned animal skins to divine the future or celebrate saints and martyrs."

Positioned high on an extinct volcano, these fortress walls have seen wars, royal births, executions and plenty of other drama since the 11th century. What really sets it apart is its reputation as one of Scotland's most haunted spots. It's no surprise that with more than 1,000 years of history, some have reported ghost sightings."

With its keen vision, eerie vocalisations and silent flight, this owl has historically been revered and feared. In folklore and mythology, owls were considered symbols of wisdom and omens of death. On Samhain, the Celtic precursor to Halloween, the owl was believed to be the kin of roaming spirits."

In Canada, as Irish immigrants settled, abundant pumpkins became the ideal substitutes for the turnips and potatoes they had previously used to create lanterns. By hollowing out pumpkins and lighting them with candles, they transformed the gourds into flickering defences against evil spirits."

This spine-tingling forest covers about 1.8 square kilometres, with its gnarled beech, hornbeam, ash and oak trees twisting toward the sky. The salty sea air from the Baltic Sea and the moist climate contribute to the trees' distorted shapes, giving rise to the forest's haunted moniker. Visitors experience light-hearted brushes with the supernatural, such as the crunch of dead leaves, a friendly spirit waving hello from afar or a mischievous ghost peeking from behind a tree. The strategic lighting, which casts ghostly shadows, along with the sculptures and decorations placed along the path, are elements that enhance the forest's ghostly aura throughout the year."

The towering presence of Mont Blanc, seen in this image, has left an indelible mark on literature, most notably on Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein.' The last Friday of October is Frankenstein Friday, honouring Shelley's literary genius and the fascinating creature born from her imagination. 'Frankenstein' was conceived during a ghost story challenge. In 1816, an 18-year-old Shelley, along with fellow writers Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Polidori and Lord Byron, spent a stormy summer in Switzerland. There, she penned the tale of Victor Frankenstein and the Creature. A pivotal scene in the novel takes place on a glacier near Mont Blanc, where Victor is confronted by his monstrous creation. This setting, with its surreal beauty and treacherous terrain, perfectly captures a sense of awe and terror."

Bodie was named after W.S. Bodey, a prospector who discovered gold but tragically died in a blizzard before seeing the town's rise. When large deposits of gold were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay."

It was once the site of an extravagant house built in the 1930s by Madame Antoinette Sherri, a flamboyant 1920s costume designer known for her lavish parties. Madame Sherri's dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalised. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back. A fire destroyed the house in 1963, leaving behind only the stone foundation, an iconic staircase and a large fireplace leading to a lone chimney."

Federico Zuccari, who built the palace, was well-versed in monsters.

Out of its waters grow pond cypress and bald cypress trees, two varieties that are native to the country. Winding through the park are over 11 kilometres of nature trails, leading visitors through sandy landscapes past a bird sanctuary and tortoise habitat."

Tourism is at the heart of its economy, and it's no surprise that most of the buzz happens along its coastline, 125 kilometres of which is covered by beaches. Today's image features Coco Beach, a gem tucked away in Nerul, a village in the northern part of the state. Despite its calm vibes, there's plenty to do here. You can soak up the sun and dive into adventures like fishing, boating, dolphin spotting and swimming, all while immersing yourself in the local culture. But there's something that makes this beach even more special: its historical significance. It played an important role in the Goa Liberation Movement during the 1950s and 60s. It was one of the places where locals fought to end Portuguese rule and unite Goa with India. So, Coco isn't just another beach; it's a place with stories to tell, where history meets the sea."

When Christian forces captured the city in 1248, the Alcázar was almost totally rebuilt in the Mudejar style, which takes inspiration from the intricate patterns and decorative motifs found in Islamic architecture. Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today."

        "description": "The Celtic Colours International Festival begins today in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia. This festival celebrates the area's inhabitants, including 19th-century settlers who came from Scotland and Ireland. Because of Cape Breton Island's isolation and the lack of outside influences, the culture and traditions of these settlers remained particularly strong. Held when the island's fall colours are most vibrant, the festival has blossomed into a nine-day extravaganza that coincides with the warm red, orange and yellow autumn foliage."

Walking through the age-old cobblestone streets, one can explore the Fortezza Orsini, a fortress-turned-museum that dates back to the 11th century. Visitors engage with centuries-old tales of power and defence with each step they take inside the fort. Near Poggio San Rocco and Poggio Croce hills lies a necropolis—a large, ancient burial site—with well-preserved Etruscan tombs that hint at the area's long history."

These trees are the most widespread native species in North America, with Pando, located in Utah's Fishlake National Forest, being a massive quaking aspen grove. Their fall foliage is breathtaking, with their leaves turning a vibrant yellow that lights up the landscape, as seen in today's photo, which was taken near Marble, Colorado."

        "description": "Today, we celebrate a creature with three hearts and the uncanny ability to change colour at will: the octopus. Octopuses are cephalopods, marine animals like squids and cuttlefish that have tentacles. Among their many species is the mototi octopus, pictured here. It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown colour but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous. But you don't need to worry about running into one, because they tend to be shy and solitary, often hiding in crevices, shells or man-made objects like bottles and cans."

Coyote Gulch is a well-known backpacking destination offering towering vertical canyon walls, narrow slot canyons, domes, arches and natural bridges to visitors. The upper reaches of the gulch lie within the Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument, while today's image showcases its lower sections in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (GCNRA). Established in 1972 and managed by the United States National Park Service, GCNRA is a conservation area that balances recreation and preservation. Unlike national parks that focus primarily on natural preservation, GCNRA offers a variety of facilities, including four public campgrounds, two small airports and several houseboat rental services, making it a popular destination for visitors."

On the banks of the Yamuna River in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India, this ivory-white marble mausoleum will certainly leave an impression. The Taj, seen in today's image, was commissioned in 1631 by Shah Jahan, the fifth Mughal emperor, to honour his beloved wife, Mumtaz Mahal. This tomb is the centrepiece of a huge complex, which also includes a mosque, a guest house and beautifully landscaped gardens surrounded by a grand wall. Laid out in a striking rectangular shape, the tomb is flanked by giant arches and alcoves that merge Indo-Islamic and Mughal architectural styles. This mausoleum draws inspiration from notable structures such as the Gur-e Amir in Samarkand, Uzbekistan, and Humayun's Tomb and Shah Jahan's Jama Masjid in Delhi."

The leaves transition to vibrant gold, amber and crimson hues, offering a visual feast. The Ogilvie Mountains in Yukon, seen here today stand tall with their highest peak, Mount Frank Rae, reaching an elevation of more than 2,300 metres. This range was named after William Ogilvie, who was a Canadian Dominion land surveyor. Part of the Yukon Ranges, these mountains are crossed by the Dempster Highway, a route famed for its pristine views. Some of the picturesque peaks of Ogilvie Mountains are located within Tombstone Territorial Park. Wildlife, from moose to Canada lynx, roams the terrain in fall, searching for the last bounties of the season. Yukon's fall is a fleeting period, characterised by crisp air and autumn hues."

Located in central California's Sierra Nevada mountain range, the park has been a popular destination for artists, mountaineers, settlers and nature lovers since the mid-1800s. To preserve the area and protect it from logging and overgrazing by cattle, the US Congress designated Yosemite a national park on this day in 1890. It's one of the most visited parks in the United States, with annual attendance exceeding 3 million, and it's a UNESCO World Heritage Site."
