        "description": "Do you sometimes get spooked? If you do, that means you have a healthy sense of fun and fear. And what better day of the year than Halloween to indulge in all things scary? The holiday we know today traces its roots to ancient traditions, including the Celts' Samhain, the Romans' Feralia, and medieval Christian observances. Today, costumed people mingle in the streets, not unlike their ancestors who donned animal skins to divine the future or celebrate saints and martyrs."

Positioned high on an extinct volcano, the castle's royal connections go back nearly 1,000 years, and its walls have witnessed wars, royal births, executions, and other dramas. But what really sets it apart, is its reputation as one of Scotland's most haunted spots."

With its keen vision, eerie vocalizations, and silent flight, this owl has historically been revered and feared. In folklore and mythology, owls were considered symbols of wisdom and omens of death. On Samhain, the Celtic precursor to Halloween, the owl was believed to be the kin of roaming spirits."

Originally from Ireland and Scotland, this craft was brought to America by immigrants who initially made lanterns from turnips and potatoes but later found pumpkins more plentiful and easier to carve. Once hollowed out and lit with candles, the gourds were transformed into flickering defenses against evil spirits."

The salty sea air, wind, and the moist climate helped mold the trees' distorted shapes, which look particularly haunting at night. Visitors to this forest in the Mecklenburg-West Pomerania region, can brave the trails alone or sign up for a storytelling session where actors dressed as ghosts bring local legends and folktales to life. Photographers and nature enthusiasts alike find inspiration in the eerie silhouettes etched against the sky, immortalized in countless pictures."

The towering presence of Mont Blanc has left an indelible mark on literature, most notably on Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein.' The last Friday of October is Frankenstein Friday, honoring Shelley's literary genius and the fascinating creature born from her imagination. 'Frankenstein' was conceived during a ghost story challenge. In 1816, an 18-year-old Shelley, along with fellow writers Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Polidori, and Lord Byron, spent a stormy summer in Switzerland. Forced inside by incessant rain, she penned the tale of Victor Frankenstein and the Creature. A pivotal scene in the novel takes place on a glacier near Mont Blanc, where Victor is confronted by his monstrous creation. This setting, with its surreal beauty and treacherous terrain, perfectly captures a sense of awe and terror."

This mining camp became a booming gold rush town in the 1870s, after a cave-in revealed a rich vein of gold. Bodie was named after W.S. Bodey, a prospector who died in a blizzard before seeing the town's rise. When large deposits were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls, and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled, and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay."

Madame Sherri's dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalized. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back. A fire destroyed the house in 1963, leaving behind only the stone foundation, an iconic staircase, and a large fireplace leading to a lone chimney."

Down an unassuming side street, there's a surprise waiting for you: a house of monsters. Welcome to the Palazzo Zuccari, a 16th-century palace where myths seem to come to life on its façade—grotesque faces swallow up its doors and windows. Federico Zuccari, who built the palace, was well-versed in monsters. His painting of the Last Judgment in Florence Cathedral and his illustrations of Dante's Inferno are replete with mythical beings. The monster door originally led to the palazzo's garden because Zuccari enjoyed making his guests experience the contrast between the scary entrance and the beautiful serenity of the garden. These days, the door leads to the Bibliotheca Hertziana, a library specializing in Italian art history, from the Middle Ages to the modern day, which has occupied the site of the garden since 1912."

Out of its waters grow pond cypress and bald cypress trees, two varieties that are native to the southeastern US. Winding through the park are over 7 miles of nature trails, leading visitors through sandy landscapes past a bird sanctuary and tortoise habitat. The hardwood trees here are a haven for woodpeckers and other birds, while the soft soil provides ideal burrowing ground for tortoises. No matter the season, this park promises a peaceful retreat for all."

When Christian forces captured the city in 1248, this historic palace was almost totally rebuilt in the Mudejar style, which takes inspiration from the intricate patterns and decorative motifs found in Islamic architecture. Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today."

        "description": "The Celtic Colours International Festival begins today in Cape Breton, Nova Scotia, Canada. This festival celebrates the area's inhabitants, including 19th-century settlers who came from Scotland and Ireland. Because of Cape Breton Island's isolation and the lack of outside influences, the culture and traditions of these settlers remained particularly strong. Held when the island's fall colors are most vibrant, the festival has blossomed into a nine-day extravaganza that coincides with the warm red, orange, and yellow autumn foliage."

        "description": "This fiery tumbleweed is kochia, which transforms landscapes when it takes on hues of red, orange, and pink in the fall. In the spring and summer, this annual herb resembles a fluffy green ball. Native to parts of Europe and Asia, kochia, also known as 'summer cypress,' is now widespread throughout the world. But it has a special place in Japan's Hitachi Seaside Park, seen in today's image, where around 30,000–40,000 kochia bushes are planted each year. These ornamental plants create a surreal landscape for visitors to wander through and also hold significance in Japanese culture. Historically, they have been dried to create brooms. However, not all parts of the kochia are destined to sweep the Earth—some are used for food. The plant's nuts, 'tonburi,' often called 'field caviar,' are a prized garnish."

Found across the western states, especially in Utah and Colorado, these trees are the most widespread native species in North America. Their fall foliage is breathtaking, with their leaves turning a vibrant yellow that lights up the landscape, as seen in today's photo, which was taken in the White River National Forest, Colorado."

        "description": "Today, we celebrate a creature with three hearts and the uncanny ability to change color at will: the octopus. Octopuses are cephalopods, marine animals like squids and cuttlefish that have tentacles. Among their many species is the small and shy mototi octopus, pictured here. It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia, and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown color but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous. But you don't need to worry about running into one, because they tend to be shy and solitary, often hiding in crevices, shells, or man-made objects like bottles and cans."

Walking through the age-old cobblestone streets, one can explore the Fortezza Orsini, a fortress-turned-museum that dates back to the 11th century. Visitors engage with centuries-old tales of power and defense with each step they take inside the fort. Near Poggio San Rocco and Poggio Croce hills lies a necropolis—a large, ancient burial site—with well-preserved Etruscan tombs that hint at the area's long history. The Etruscan civilization inhabited this area and flourished in what is now Tuscany and Umbria between the 8th and 3rd centuries BCE."

The park, in central California's Sierra Nevada range, has been a popular destination for artists, mountaineers, settlers, and nature lovers since the mid-1800s. To protect it from logging and overgrazing by cattle, Congress designated Yosemite a national park on this day in 1890. It's one of the most visited parks in the US, with more than 3 million visitors a year."
