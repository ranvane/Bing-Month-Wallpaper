        "description": "Do you sometimes get spooked? If you do, that means you have a healthy sense of fun and fear. And what better day of the year than Halloween to indulge in all things scary? The holiday we know today traces its roots to ancient traditions, including the Celts' Samhain, the Romans' Feralia and medieval Christian observances. Today, costumed people mingle in the streets, not unlike their ancestors who donned animal skins to divine the future or celebrate saints and martyrs."

Positioned high on an extinct volcano, these fortress walls have seen wars, royal births, executions and plenty of other drama since the 11th century. But what really sets it apart is its reputation as one of Scotland's most haunted spots. It's no surprise that with more than 1,000 years of history, some have reported ghost sightings."

With its keen vision, eerie vocalisations and silent flight, this owl has historically been revered and feared. In folklore and mythology, owls were considered symbols of wisdom and omens of death. On Samhain, the Celtic precursor to Halloween, the owl was believed to be the kin of roaming spirits."

Originally from Ireland and Scotland, this craft was taken to America by immigrants who initially used turnips and potatoes to create lanterns, but later found pumpkins more plentiful and easier to carve. By hollowing out pumpkins and lighting them with candles, they transformed the gourds into flickering defences against evil spirits."

At 2 AM this morning, the clocks fell back one hour, meaning there was an extra hour of sleep. While the idea of summer time was mentioned in 1784 by American inventor Benjamin Franklin, the first serious proposal for changing the clocks in the United Kingdom came from British builder William Willett in 1907. He valued having more daylight and felt so strongly about this that he published a pamphlet called 'The Waste of Daylight. Over time, many countries adopted the practice to give people more daylight in the evenings during the summer months."

This spine-tingling forest covers about 445 acres (180 hectares), with its gnarled beech, hornbeam, ash and oak trees twisting toward the sky. The salty sea air from the Baltic Sea and the moist climate contribute to the trees' distorted shapes, giving rise to the forest's haunted moniker. Visitors experience light-hearted brushes with the supernatural, such as the crunch of dead leaves, a friendly spirit waving hello from afar or a mischievous ghost peeking from behind a tree. The strategic lighting, which casts ghostly shadows, along with the sculptures and decorations placed along the path, are elements that enhance the forest's ghostly aura throughout the year."

The towering presence of Mont Blanc, seen in this image, has left an indelible mark on literature, most notably on Mary Shelley's 'Frankenstein.' The last Friday of October is Frankenstein Friday, honouring Shelley's literary genius and the fascinating creature born from her imagination. 'Frankenstein' was conceived during a ghost story challenge. In 1816, an 18-year-old Shelley, along with fellow writers Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Polidori and Lord Byron, spent a stormy summer in Switzerland. There, she penned the tale of Victor Frankenstein and the Creature. A pivotal scene in the novel takes place on a glacier near Mont Blanc, where Victor is confronted by his monstrous creation. This setting, with its surreal beauty and treacherous terrain, perfectly captures a sense of awe and terror."

Bodie was named after WS Bodey, a prospector who discovered gold but tragically died in a blizzard before seeing the town's rise. When large deposits of gold were found there, it grew to nearly 10,000 residents, with saloons, dance halls and breweries lining its streets. But as the gold ran dry, so did the town's fortunes. The mines closed, the population dwindled, and by 1915, the place was abandoned. Bodie's streets are now empty, its wooden buildings frozen in decay."

Madame Sherri's dramatic arrivals in town, often in a chauffeur-driven Packard, draped in furs, became the talk of the locals. As her fortune declined, her 'castle' fell into disrepair and was vandalised. In 1959, she returned to find her property in ruins and never came back. A fire destroyed the house in 1963, leaving behind only the stone foundation, an iconic staircase and a large fireplace leading to a lone chimney."

The park's centrepiece, seen in today's image, is a 412-acre (167-hectare) mill pond, a favourite spot for fishing and canoeing. Out of its waters grow pond cypress and bald cypress trees, two varieties that are native to the United States. Winding through the park are over 7 miles of nature trails, leading visitors through sandy landscapes past a bird sanctuary and tortoise habitat. The hardwood trees here are a haven for woodpeckers and other birds, while the soft soil provides ideal burrowing ground for tortoises. No matter the season, this park promises a peaceful retreat for all."

Trees sense the coming of winter not only by temperature, but by the angle at which light from sunrises and sunsets hits their leaves. Because of New York's buildings, the unique interaction of light, shadows and temperatures often results in fall foliage occurring later in the park than the rest of the city."

But what really steals the show are the fossils, especially those of belemnites and ammonites—extinct marine creatures—that are pictured here. Mary Anning, a pioneering fossil hunter who combed these shores, paved the way for our current understanding of fossils. Lyme Regis and Charmouth are hotspots for fossil hunting. In these towns, you'll find beaches where fossils practically wash up at your feet. The coast's rock formations are more than just pretty to look at—they're iconic. Durdle Door, a natural limestone arch, and Old Harry Rocks, a set of chalk formations near Swanage, are some of the examples."

Within the Alcázar, there are several courtyards lined with delicately carved columns. One of these is the Patio de las Doncellas, or Courtyard of the Maidens, pictured here today."

The Arctic tern outshines them all with its intercontinental journey from pole to pole, covering more than 18,000 miles. Their migration routes are passages created based on environmental cues."

        "description": "Welcome to 'the loveliest spot that man hath ever found' Grasmere in the Lake District, England. Known for its connections to the 'Lake Poets' like William and Dorothy Wordsworth, the area offers more than just poetry—it's a feast for the eyes in autumn. Its name harks back to Old English and Old Norse, suggesting a lake flanked by greenery. For those up for more of a climb, hikes to the hill of Helm Crag provide a higher perspective of this place's beauty. The annual Grasmere Sports, dating back to 1852, includes the age-old tradition of Cumberland wrestling and fell running. And for the sweet-toothed? The legendary Grasmere Gingerbread, popularised by Victorian cook Sarah Nelson in the 19th century, whose recipe remains a guarded secret, is an irresistible treat."

Walking through the age-old cobblestone streets, one can explore the Fortezza Orsini, a fortress-turned-museum that dates to the 11th century. Visitors engage with centuries-old tales of power and defence with each step they take inside the fort. Near Poggio San Rocco and Poggio Croce hills lies a necropolis—a large, ancient burial site—with well-preserved Etruscan tombs that hint at the area's long history."

Found across the western states, especially in Utah and Colorado, these trees are the most widespread native species in North America. Their autumn foliage is breathtaking, with their leaves turning a vibrant yellow that lights up the landscape, as seen in today's photo, which was taken near Marble, Colorado. Aspens are not only beautiful but also biologically fascinating. They grow in large colonies that originate from a single root system, making them some of the largest living organisms on Earth."

        "description": "Today, we celebrate a creature with three hearts and the uncanny ability to change colour at will: the octopus. Octopuses are cephalopods, marine animals like squids and cuttlefish that have tentacles. Among their many species is the mototi octopus, pictured here. It was discovered in 1999 around Rapa Island in the South Pacific and is known for the 'fake eyes' or ocelli—vibrant blue and yellow rings—between its eyes and arms. Found in the Indo-Pacific region, including Indonesia, Australia and Okinawa in Japan, mototi octopuses are masters of disguise. They usually have a dull orange-cream-brown colour but when alarmed, they can quickly shift to striking maroon with white stripes along their body and arms. Also known as poison ocellate octopuses, these cephalopods are highly venomous. But you don't need to worry about running into one, because they tend to be shy and solitary, often hiding in crevices, shells or man-made objects like bottles and cans."

Coyote Gulch is a well-known backpacking destination offering towering vertical canyon walls, narrow slot canyons, domes, arches and natural bridges to visitors. The upper reaches of the gulch lie within the Grand Staircase–Escalante National Monument, while today's image showcases its lower sections in the Glen Canyon National Recreation Area (GCNRA). Established in 1972 and managed by the United States National Park Service, GCNRA is a conservation area that balances recreation and preservation. Unlike national parks that focus primarily on natural preservation, GCNRA offers a variety of facilities, including four public campgrounds, two small airports and several houseboat rental services, making it a popular destination for visitors."

A tradition since 1994, it unites people from bustling cities to serene lochs in a celebration of verse on the first Thursday of every October. Founded by William Sieghart, this event aims to make poetry more visible and engaging. It's a day when Prince Charles might recite Seamus Heaney, and train announcement boards become stanzas of TS Eliot and Auden. Everyday spaces transform into stages for the spoken word—a railway station or supermarket might suddenly echo with an epic. This year the special day focuses on the theme of 'counting.' So today, our image of Loch Morlich in Cairngorms National Park, Scotland provides the perfect backdrop for finding poetic inspiration. Why not let poetry alight upon your day?"
